{{-- 
Original PHP logic has been removed and should be moved to a controller.
This file should not contain direct database access or authentication logic.
Instead, authentication should use Laravel's built-in Auth system.

Original file contained:
- Email/password extraction from POST
- Database connection and query
- User validation and authentication
- Cookie setting
- Page redirection
