# SoVest Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development phases for the SoVest stock prediction and investment platform. The plan encompasses the ongoing modernization efforts, including the migration from raw SQL to Eloquent ORM, and potential future upgrades to a full Laravel framework implementation.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Database Structure Enhancement (Completed)
*Timeline: 4 weeks*

- Implementation of environment variable management for database configuration
- Initial database schema design and implementation
- Creation of core database tables (users, stocks, predictions)
- Development of search-related database structures

### Phase 2: SQL to Eloquent ORM Migration (Current Phase)
*Timeline: 8 weeks*

- Creation of Eloquent ORM models for all entities
- Implementation of model relationships and validations
- Development of DatabaseService abstraction layer
- Conversion of raw SQL queries to Eloquent in core application files
- Implementation of proper migration scripts for database schema changes

### Phase 3: Application Restructuring
*Timeline: 6 weeks*

- Code organization improvements following MVC patterns
- Implementation of service classes for business logic
- Refactoring of authentication system
- Development of consistent error handling approach
- Standardization of input validation across the application

### Phase 4: Frontend Modernization
*Timeline: 5 weeks*

- Implementation of consistent UI design
- Separation of presentation and business logic
- Enhancement of responsive design for mobile devices
- Improvement of JavaScript interaction patterns
- Implementation of AJAX for smoother user experience

### Phase 5: Feature Expansion
*Timeline: 7 weeks*

- Development of advanced stock prediction algorithms
- Implementation of social features for users
- Creation of comprehensive notification system
- Development of reporting and analytics features
- Enhancement of user profile capabilities

### Phase 6: Laravel Migration (Future Direction)
*Timeline: 13-19 weeks*

As analyzed in the [Laravel Migration Analysis Report](SoVest_code/docs/laravel_migration_analysis.md), moving to a full Laravel framework would be the next logical step after completing the current Eloquent ORM modernization.

#### Key Benefits

- **Development Speed**: 30-40% reduction in development time for new features through Laravel's built-in tools, including Artisan CLI, authentication scaffolding, and form request validation
- **Security**: Enhanced protection through CSRF prevention, robust authentication, middleware pipeline, and comprehensive input validation
- **Maintainability**: Improved code organization through enforced MVC architecture, dependency injection, testing framework, and consistent coding standards
- **Scalability**: Better performance and growth capacity through integrated caching, queue system, connection pooling, and API development tools

#### Implementation Approach

The Laravel migration would follow a phased approach:
1. Initial assessment and Laravel project setup (1-2 weeks)
2. Core architecture migration including models and database (3-4 weeks)
3. Business logic migration to controllers and services (4-6 weeks)
4. Frontend migration to Blade templates (3-4 weeks)
5. Testing and deployment preparation (2-3 weeks)

## Ongoing Processes

Throughout all development phases, the following processes will be maintained:

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing of all features
- Code reviews for all significant changes
- Regular security audits
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Documentation
- Maintenance of technical documentation
- Creation and updates to user guides
- API documentation for all services
- Regular updates to this development plan

### Project Management
- Bi-weekly sprint planning and reviews
- Regular stakeholder updates
- Resource allocation and timeline adjustments
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a structured roadmap for the SoVest project, from the current Eloquent ORM modernization through potential future Laravel migration. By following this plan, the project aims to achieve a modern, maintainable, and scalable application architecture while continuously delivering value to users.

The plan will be reviewed and updated quarterly to reflect changing requirements, technologies, and priorities.
